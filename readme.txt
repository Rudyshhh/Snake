In this project, I have created a classic snake game using Python and the Pygame library, with the exciting addition of an apple biting sound effect. The game offers a nostalgic gaming experience while incorporating an engaging audio element that adds to the overall fun and enjoyment.

Key Features:
Snake Movement: Players control a snake using arrow keys to navigate through the game board.
Apple Spawning: Apples randomly spawn at different locations on the game board, serving as the snake's food.
Apple Biting Sound: Upon successfully capturing an apple, the game triggers a delightful "apple biting" sound effect, providing immediate auditory feedback to the player.
Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the player's score, incrementing it with each apple captured.
Collision Detection: The player's snake must avoid colliding with itself or the game board's boundaries to prevent losing the game.
Increasing Length: As the player captures apples, the snake's length increases, making it more challenging to navigate and avoid collisions.

Technical Details:
Programming Language: Python
Game Library: Pygame
Graphics and game elements are rendered using Pygame functions.
The "apple biting" sound effect is integrated using Pygame's sound capabilities.
The game board is managed using a grid system to ensure seamless movement and positioning of the snake and apples.
The project showcases my skills in Python programming and game development using the Pygame library. It represents a fun and entertaining way to learn more about game development and audio integration within games.
